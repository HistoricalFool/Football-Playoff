# Austria Notes
For the Austria paper, I am sure you have not really been able to get too much into it as you are very busy and the semester only just ended, but I am super bored (internship market sucks) so wanted to run a few things I could do by you. First, would it be worthwhile to go ahead and gather data from the other leagues which implemented a playoff system? I think getting leagues which are close to the Austrian League’s competition ranking would be best, so I will go through the UEFA rankings and pick 2-3 which are close. Beyond that, I was thinking of looking into other literature surrounding competition design (if it exists) so that there is some baseline of what I could be looking for. I think the main area where help will be needed is knowing which modeling framework to use. Obviously we have the whole summer, I am just antsy to do something fun with my time, lol.

Found Greece has an almost exact match to the Austria system (champion and relegation group), while Belgium’s is much more complicated (3 groups competing for different competitions). We now have two leagues for comparison + can analyze a traditional league like Dutch or German.

Seems like Greece started playoffs in 2019-2020 season. Belgium started in 2020-2021. I believe Austria reintroduced in 2018. I would think this is good as they all have a similar timeline in contemporary football, and Austria had it in the 80’s.

Just found out Turkish super lig had a playoff “system” for determining who goes to champions league and one for Europa. Will send for the season I found it in.

93-94 is when playoffs ended and they added more teams back in. I guess that could be a factor as to why average total attendance increased. There should be other factors though. I will look into overall UEFA Champions/Europa league rules changing and see if TV viewership increased or something. But the fact that the dips seem to coincide around the rule change is very interesting.

## From Wikipedia:
  In the Bundesliga, twelve teams play a double round-robin schedule, with each team playing every other once at home and away during the regular season. The league table is then separated into two parts, with the teams ranked first through sixth continuing into the Championship Round, and the remaining teams ranked seventh to twelfth competing in the Relegation Round. The points obtained during the regular season are then halved (and rounded down) before the start of the two playoffs. Each group of six teams play another double round robin schedule, with one home and one away game against each of their five opponents. At the end of the season, the team finishing top of the Championship Round is crowned champion of the Bundesliga. The team finishing in last place in the table in the Relegation Round is demoted to the Admiral 2. Liga, the champion of which is promoted in their place. Teams in the Admiral Bundesliga first division thus play 32 games in a league season between August and May.

  In the 74–75 season the Bundesliga was introduced which, still led by the Austrian Football Association, aligned both of the highest divisions in Austria. In 1976, the Nationalliga was renamed to Bundesliga – Second Division while the Bundesliga was now called Bundesliga – First Division.[11] From 1974 to 1982 the league operated with ten clubs with each club playing the other four times during the season. From 1982 to 1985 it played with sixteen clubs with each club playing the others twice. The league's modus was changed in 1985 to a twelve team league which played a home -and away round in autumn. The top eight clubs then advanced to the championship round (Officially: Oberes Play-off) who again played each other twice. The bottom four of the autumn round played the top four of the First League to determine the four teams to play in the Bundesliga in the following season. This modus was used for the next eight seasons until 1993 when the league returned to the ten team format it originally operated in.

## 9/12 Addition - TM:

* Main idea - Why playoffs?:
    * Weather based?
    * UCL/UEL distribution
        * i.e. parity in who goes to European comps
    * Parity generally?
    * Attendance boost?
* Other leagues for comparison
    * Denmark, Belgium, greece
        * Playoff leagues
    * Germany, Netherlands, turkey
        * Traditional seasons and in same region
    * Brazilian state competitions vs league?
* Data:
    * Attendance
    * Tables
    * Expenditures and earnings
    * UEFA rankings of nations and leagues
    * Weather data(?)
    * Team sizes
* Benefit of playoff ideas:
    * Relegation excitement
    * Fairer qual for europe
